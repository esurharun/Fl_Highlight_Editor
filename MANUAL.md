# Fl_Highlight_Editor manual

## Introduction

This manual will try to give you some introduction on how to use
Fl_Highlight_Editor widget and how to extend the builtin language with
own constructs, modes and highlight styles. No previous Emacs
knowlege is assumed (e.g. you don't have to know what are faces or
styles) but basic Scheme, C++ and FLTK knowledge is required.

If you are not familiar with the Scheme language, please read
[Yet Another Scheme Tutorial](http://www.shido.info/lisp/idx_scm_e.html)
or any other online tutorial you find suitable (after all, there are
many Scheme tutorials online).
