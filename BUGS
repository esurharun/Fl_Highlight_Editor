* Known bugs [1/6]
  - [ ] Block handling isn't good: if block is in multiple lines, due
    how optimized repaint routine hi_update() works, it will only
    match the first line since hi_update() will send only modified
    chunks of text, and often block start will not be in those

  - [ ] Repaint to previous state: for example, open block comment
    (for C code), the whole text up to the EOF will be painted with
    comment-face (or anything assigned to it). When block comment was
    closed, some text will still have commented colors, even if it
    isn't inside block.

  - [ ] TinyScheme GC can leak some memory. Valgrind reports only
    indirect loss, so I'm not sure how serious this is. This problem
    can be solved by using scheme_init_custom_alloc() and tracking
    malloc/free calls, where the rest will be free-ed in widget destructor.
	
  - [X] Inside '(syn ...)' construct it is not possible to evaluate
    forms nor to get variables for top environment.

  - [ ] (set-tab-width) and (get-tab-width) works only when buffer
    was loaded, so *editor-after-loadfile-hook* must be used to setup
    correct size. This can be fixed by adding (global-set-tab-width)
    that will store tab width globally (by widget instance) and apply
	when buffer was created.

  - [ ] When unknown file (or file for which mode isn't defined) was
    loaded, latest used mode is used. This should be reverted to some
    default look.
